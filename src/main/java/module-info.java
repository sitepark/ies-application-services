/**
 * Application Services module for orchestrating operations across multiple bounded contexts.
 *
 * <p>This module contains application services that coordinate use cases from different core
 * modules (userrepository-core, security-core, etc.) to implement complex business workflows.
 *
 * <p><b>Responsibilities:</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Orchestrate multiple use cases from different bounded contexts
 *   <li>Manage cross-context workflows (e.g., user creation with password)
 *   <li>Provide convenient APIs for controllers to avoid code duplication
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This is the Application Layer in Clean Architecture. It does NOT contain
 * business logic - it only coordinates use cases that already contain the business logic.
